# ThirdParty-Register
Registration and login buttons with Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google in react

This repository shows an example of how to implement Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google register and login buttons with react
The react components for each button are contained in the Javascript Files folder,
the API Controller is contained in the Controllers folder,
the Data Service is contained in the Services folder,
and the stored procedures are contained in the Stored Procedures folder, only the LinkedIn Insert and SelectProviderId have been included
because Facebook and Google are written the same way

These files were made as part of a larger project with a twelve member team
